# The Problem

## General

### General Definition of the problem
The projects definitions require a trading game with little limitations beyond that basic criteria. As a fan of multiple different large fanbases (fandoms), i saw a problem as there is not a single game that unifies all feilds under one consistant roof. The problem was then obvious, there was no unified game.

### General Needs & Objectives
To solve the problem i would need to smoothly combine the different worlds of these fandoms without loosing elements of them. For example, I coulnt have superheroes in the world of The Office as that would loose the humanity of The Office. So my objective was to preserve the essence of the fandoms. A vital need of the game was to have consistnacy over the different fandoms in apperance.

### General Solutions
The desision i made was to incorporate the multiverse to link the fandoms, that was they could all be connected but not interfeer with eachother, rather the player would be the one connecting them through a unified currency (credits). To keep the astetic the same, I would use the same base template, background, font and colour across the worlds, only changing stock prices and companies.


## Specific

### Specific Problem: Multiverse Apperance

The simplicity and ease of use of the multiverse in my game is a vital component. The multiverse, however simple to me, is a complicated concept that for some other users of the game, might be complicated in consept and in use if not set out properly. To combat this there are two things to consider, appearance, and the code. The appearance of the multiverse must be intuitive and simple. This is acheived by multive minor effects. When the user hovers over an earth to be chosen, two things happen that give visual feedback to the user. Firstly the earth wobbles, and secondly, the earths name / number is displayed in the lower right corner of the screen. This indicates that the earths can be clicked on, and each earth is different and unique. The code is also simple, and by using multiver extended functions and loops, there is a perfect consistancy through the interface and the same thing happens for all earth.

### Specific Problem: Banking System

The banking sytem in the game became a large problem through development. The criteria required a banking system to facilitate loans, and as my game was stock trading, loans are obviosly very important. A major problem was where the bank would be, and its accessability to the user. The problem was that in any way, if the bank was accesable direct from an earth, users could use the banking feature whist on their first earth, and essentially skip the importnat proccess of earning their first profits. I made the conscious decision to put the bank in the multiverse meaning that the bank was accesible for loans at the very begining but once you selected your starting earth, the bank was no longer availible untill you unlock the space stone allowing you to travel the multiverse. The other large problem was restricting loans. If a quarter of the players net credit (credit - debt) less than the loan request, the request would be denyed by the bank, and a quater of the net credit was less than the debt plus the requested loan, it would also be denyed.

### Specific Problem: Breaking News

The breaking news random even was another issue in the building of the assingment. The location of the news was integral as it would need to be on the earth, and seperate to the companies.
