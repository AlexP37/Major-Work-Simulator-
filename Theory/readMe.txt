Hey Sir,

Please download the MacDown Markdown reader application for the full viewing experience of the following theory documents. Available at https://macdown.uranusjr.com/. Alternatively, the application is bundled in with these files in this directory, if it is not functional, you may need to use given download link.

To open .md files with MacDown, simply right click and then select open with... and then choose MacDown, or open MacDown and choose File, then Open from the menu bar and navigate to the file.

To hide and show the editor and viewer plane, click the button in the top right hand corner. Best viewing experience is in portrait mode, approx. half the screen wide (this is where the width and font size align as per a pdf would).

Sure you knew all that and probably already use MacDown, but just in case, thought i would mention it.

Regards,
Alex
